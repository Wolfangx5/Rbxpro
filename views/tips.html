        <h2 class="subtitle">Tips to Maximize Your Earnings 🤑</h2>

        <p>Follow these tips and tricks to increase your chances of qualifying for surveys and earning more rewards on RBXPRO.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Choose Your Date of Birth Wisely</h3>
        <p>Some surveys may target a specific age group or demographic, so you need to be careful about the date of birth you enter. A good rule of thumb is to say that you are around <strong>25 years old</strong>, which means you were born in 1996. Always keep it consistent across surveys. For example, use <strong>April 13, 1996</strong>. If asked about children, say they are <strong>5 years old</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Choosing Your ZIP Code</h3>
        <p>Open Google and search for "Postal code." Choose a ZIP code and ensure it matches the code you use when completing surveys. Consistency is key!</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Avoid Certain Industries</h3>
        <p>Always <strong>say NO</strong> if asked whether you or your family members work in industries like advertising, marketing, media, or research. Instead, select industries like <strong>IT Hardware</strong> or <strong>IT Services</strong>, which are preferred by survey providers.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Be Realistic About Your Income</h3>
        <p>When asked about your income, choose a realistic range. A good option is around <strong>$150,000</strong>, which is above average but not unrealistic.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">State Your Education Level</h3>
        <p>Select <strong>Undergraduate</strong> as your education level. This makes you eligible for most surveys without appearing overqualified.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Select Your Employment Status</h3>
        <p>Choose <strong>Full-Time</strong> as your employment status. Additionally, select big roles like <strong>CEO</strong> and say you work in companies with <strong>1,000-5,000 employees</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Claim Your Purchasing Decisions</h3>
        <p>Always state that you <strong>make all purchasing decisions</strong> in your household. This increases your value for surveys focused on consumer habits.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Cater to the Survey Topic</h3>
        <p>Adjust your answers to fit the survey topic. For instance, if a survey is about smartphones, claim that you own and use one regularly.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Watch Out for Test Questions</h3>
        <p>Some surveys include test questions to ensure you're paying attention. Read every question carefully to avoid disqualification.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Be Honest and Consistent</h3>
        <p>Honesty and consistency are essential. Stick to the profile you’ve created and answer truthfully to avoid disqualifications.</p>

        <h3 class="highlight">Bonus Tip</h3>
        <p>You can use different devices to complete the same offer. For example, use a parent's or sibling's device to increase your earnings.</p>
